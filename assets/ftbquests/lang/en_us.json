 "ftbquests.chapter.1DAF9330DA4C83A2.quests3.description12": "Metamorphic rocks are formed when the aforementioned rocks undergo a process called metamorphism.

 "ftbquests.chapter.1DAF9330DA4C83A2.quests12.description2": "Because logs are large items, they can’t be stored in any of TFC World’s standard storage blocks. The correct way to store logs is to hold them and sneak-right-click on the ground to create a log pile. This block can store up to 16 logs, and you can add more logs before it’s full.",
